## Old Event Pages
* Mike wants Jmo to put a no crawl on event pages after the year has passed so they don't show up in searches

## Adult Programs
* Program descriptions (concentration names in the banner data grid)
     * Proposed descriptions won't work because they ARE used elsewhere and they need the context of the program (MBA: Global Management Concentration)
     * 3 options
          * Manage full name in Cascade
          * Have a drop down - concentration, license, major, etc.
          * Change the 'program details' heading on the page to "Concentration Program Details" or something to give more context
* Core program codes
     * Some concentrations don't have a core program code
     * Counseling Psychology has one but you CAN'T just take the general program
     * Business Management might not have one at all
     * Mike says we should just guess at the program code?
