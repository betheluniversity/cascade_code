## Meeting Notes
Mike, Erik, Tim, Jake, Andrea
### Old Event Pages
* Mike wants Jmo to put a no crawl on event pages after the year has passed so they don't show up in searches

### Adult Programs
* Program descriptions (concentration names in the banner data grid)
     * Proposed descriptions won't work because they ARE used elsewhere and they need the context of the program (MBA: Global Management Concentration)
     * 3 options
          * Manage full name in Cascade
          * Have a drop down - concentration, license, major, etc.
          * Change the 'program details' heading on the page to "Concentration Program Details" or something to give more context
* Core program codes
     * Some concentrations don't have a core program code
     * Counseling Psychology has one but you CAN'T just take the general program
     * Business Management might not have one at all
     * Mike says we should just guess at the program code?

### Page Titles and Concentration Names
* Program details page title: include full program name (M.S. in Physician Assistant Program Details)
* Program details display name: just "Program Details"
* Concentration page title: include full program name (B.A. in Organizational Leadership: Human Resources Management Concentration)
