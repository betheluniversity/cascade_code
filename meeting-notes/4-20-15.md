## Meeting Notes
Eric, Andrea, Erik, AnnMarie

### MBA Launch - What needs to be done?
* Banner data is still off -- mba, management, global, finance, global management -- which of these are being offered? **global and global management have the same code**
* Nightly sync needs to be turned on
* We need a process in place for when we get an email about a new, removed, or changed code BEFORE we launch the first site
* Concentration detail pages
     * Jake to finish/approve styling/formatting
     * Colons after bolded words
     * Spell out Average instead of abbreviating (if not in a table)
     * Remove location from the online section
     * Total Credits need to be separate from the delivery formats
* Courses need to be finished
     * Jmo said they should be done this afternoon
     * Jmo will make them paragraph text (instead of headings) https://staging.bethel.edu/_testing/jmo/block-pages/course-catalog
     * Jake should approve styling
* Redirects -- amv
* Site proofed and tested on different browsers, devices, etc. (once design is finalized)

### Random Notes
* Contact Admissions button gets cut off on smaller screen - should we change to "Contact Us"

### News Article Feeds
* Publishing should be unchecked
* Indexing should be checked
* 
### M.S. in Nursing
* This program is called M.S. Nurse Educator now
* Do we change the system name to nurse-educator instead of nursing? -- no, because it's already on the sell sheet
* Do we need to change the metadata?
* The program name has completely changed which isn't normal of adding/removing concentrations
* bethel.edu/nursing takes you to M.S. Nurse Educator
