### Program Block
* "Concentration" is showing up on this page but not sure where it's coming from - https://staging.bethel.edu/graduate/academics/special-education/program-details/special-education
* Space before and after the comma in the table - https://staging.bethel.edu/graduate/academics/special-education/program-details/
* Writers are writing concentration and program descriptions - we'll load those when they're done
* Program length isn't populating the "Avg. Completion Time" cell in the table
* The "H" and "F2" delivery code isn't working
* Writers need to write something for delivery description and Jame-o will hard code it in based on the delivery code
